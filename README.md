# Reforged
A successor (not port) of Balkon's Weapon Mod, will add primitive, medieval and some gunpowder weapons. <br>
This successor has been created by Silvercatcher and ThexXTURBOXx. <br>
We have taken some textures of BalkondeurAlpha to test WIP-Things. <br>
Other textures are by Snow_Yoshi98, baddaspig and Sunconure11. <br>

Reforged - Balkon's Weapon Mod for 1.8? <br>
Yes, it is! But it is in early development. Much things won't work properly. Use at your own risk, could crash your world never to be played again! <br>

You want to have this mod translated to your language? You know 2 languages? Then fork this repository (Click on "Fork" in the upper right). Navigate to /resources/assets/reforged/lang/ and copy one of the lang-files. The new file needs to be named after your language-code. The code for your language can be found [here](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Language#Available_languages). Translate as much Text-Strings as you can *without* changing %1$s and similar. You can then create a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/TheOnlySilverClaw/Reforged/compare) and we will include your language into the mod. <br>
Thank you! ^^
