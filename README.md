# On Hold

This project is on hold for now.<br>
@ Everyone, who wants to contribute: **I won't help you in learning Java/Minecraft modding. If you want to contribute,
learn it by _yourself_ as I did. If you aren't willing to do that, don't ask me if you may contribute. Only ask me, if
you _really_ want to do this _completely_ on your own and already know the basics of how modding works**

A successor (not port) of Balkon's Weapon Mod, will add primitive, medieval and some gunpowder weapons. <br>
This successor has been created by Silvercatcher and ThexXTURBOXx. <br>
We have taken some textures of BalkondeurAlpha to test WIP-Things. <br>
Other textures are by Snow_Yoshi98, baddaspig and Sunconure11. <br>

Reforged - Balkon's Weapon Mod for 1.8+? <br>
Yes, it is! But it is in early development. Much things won't work properly. Use at your own risk, could crash your
world never to be played again! <br>

## Translation

You want to have this mod translated to your language? You know 2 languages?
Then [fork this repository](https://github.com/ThexXTURBOXx/Reforged/fork). Navigate to
src/main/resources/assets/reforged/lang/ and copy one of the lang-files. The new file needs to be named after your
language-code. The code for your language can be found [here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Language#Languages).
Translate as much Text-Strings as you can *without* changing %1$s and similar. You can then create a
new [Pull Request](https://github.com/ThexXTURBOXx/Reforged/compare) and we will include your language into the
mod. <br>
